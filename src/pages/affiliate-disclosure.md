In the era of 2015, the Federal Trade Commission released its new rules for Disclosure Compliance.

These rules are designed to ensure that readers or web media viewers are aware if a blogger or publisher is a sponsored, endorsed or partnered with a different company. Readers need to know if content publishers are making money by sharing a link or product.

In compliance with the FTC guidelines, please understand the following about the links and posts on this site:

Any / all links on [](https://www.bestofsoundbar.com/)www.monitorstvhub.com are affiliate links for which I get a small fee from the sale of certain items.

### **What Are Affiliate Links?**

Purchases are made on external affiliate company's websites: When a reader clicks on an affiliate link on www.monitorstvhub.com to buy an item, the reader buys the item directly from the seller.

Amazon and other companies pay a small commission or other paid www.monitorstvhub.com to help customers to their website.

Prices are the same for all the readers whether they buy through an affiliate link or an unlinked link. Clicking on an affiliate link and clicking on an unrelated link does not change the value or anything else for the visitor.
