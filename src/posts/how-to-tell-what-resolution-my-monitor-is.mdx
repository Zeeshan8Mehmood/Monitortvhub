  Without a shadow of a doubt, knowing Screen Resolution has become an important
  thing to many of us. You’ll be hard-pressed either running games or watching
  movies in HD or UHD formats to make sure about what screen resolution your
  Monitor can support. 


  Let’s make it easy to understand how you can detect the screen-resolution.


  If you’re on Windows OS, then by default, the steps are;


  Click the right key of your mouse if you have, or use the laptop mouse-pad. Then, from the list of settings> Select “screen resolution.” There you will be able to see the information about your resolution.


  The resolution marked “recommended” is the maximum number your Monitor can support. If your intentions are to increase it even further, unfortunately, it’s not possible unless you buy a new monitor that has support for more pixels by default. 


  If you don’t know how to make sure exactly what the numbers are telling?As there will be basically two numbers, and if you don’t know which number is important to know about your monitor’s resolution. Let’s understand this first.


  Let’s take an example, assuming that you see these numbers; **1920x1080 or 1280x720**.


  To tell anyone about your monitor’s screen resolution. You’ll need to say to them the second number. If it’s 720, then it’s going to be 720p HD, similarly 1080p HD, 1440p ultra HD, and 1920p means 4k.


  For example, in 1980to1080, the second number is the screen resolution to tell you about your monitor’s screen resolution. Which is here, 1080px. Similarly, this states that your monitor can support 1080px games, videos, or any content. In other words, it is usually referred to as HD resolution.


  Conversely, the first number is always going to be higher than the second number for the reason that they refer to screen sizes—height into width.


  If all this is clear, let’s dig into the steps to find out the regulations of different systems.


  ## How do I know what resolution my monitor is?


  If the most straightforward method is not a way for you. Here are some alternative steps you can follow.


  ## On Windows 10


  ### Step.1 Get into the Settings


  Hover your mouse cursor all the way to the bottom-left corner. Exactly where the start icon is located on Windows. Hit the right click on your mouse, from there. Click on the settings. You’ll land on the setting’s page. Follow next if this is done.


  ### Step.2 Choose Ease of Access.


  ![Ease of Access](/img/ease-of-access.png "Ease of Access")


  From the bunch of settings on the setting’s option, Open the “ease of access” section by pressing double left-click on your Mouse. 


  ### Step.3. Go to Additional display settings.


  ![Additional display settings](/img/additional-display-settings.png "Additional display settings")


  On this page, click on the option “additional display settings” as shown in the image. It will take you to advance display settings. There, you can see the resolution of your monitor.


  ### Step.4 Click on the resolution box.


  ![resolution box](/img/resolution-box.png "resolution box")


  On this page, you can see a box filled with “resolution.” A marked “recommended” is often located there if you’ve opened it for the first time. 


  Suppose you don’t see recommended names by-side. At that moment, you can always set the resolution to maximum support. As the word also recommended hints that set up the maximum screen size.


  When I click on this box, a bunch of different screen resolutions appears in a drop-down way. I’ve already set the maximum resolution that my monitor can support. 


  ![scale and layout](/img/scale-and-layout.png "scale and layout")


  And if someone asks me about what resolution your monitor can support or has? I answer them 900px as aforementioned that the second value, which is height means is the resolution that is mostly calculated by people.


  If someone says his monitor has support for 720px. Then, most likely, he is also referring to the second value of the monitor.


  ## On Windows 8


  ### Step.1 Move cursor right> Click on Setting


  ![Move cursor right](/img/move-cursor-right.png "Move cursor right")


  Move your mouse cursor right side, hold the pointer there for a while unless you see something coming out—something like a starting Windows option. And there, at the bottom. Click on the setting option.


  ### Step.2 Go to the personalization


  ![Go to the personalization](/img/go-to-the-personalization.png "Go to the personalization")


  After clicking on the settings, you will see this same page as shown in the image. Click on the personalization option.


  ### Step.3 Click on the Display option


  ![Click on the Display option](/img/click-on-the-display-option.png "Click on the Display option")


  At the left-bottom, choose the display option.

  However, from this point, you also follow the same steps as we’ve mentioned for Windows 10. On Windows OS(s), most likely settings are the same.


  I’m showing here the alternative method, and it’s for the reason if you are stuck one way. You can go with the alternative method. 


  ### Step.4 Choose Adjust personalization Option


  ![Choose Adjust personalization Option](/img/choose-adjust-personalization-option.png "Choose Adjust personalization Option")


  From now, At the right-sidebar, choose the Adjust resolution option. You will be taken to a new page, where you can see the resolution.


  You can also adjust brightness or 


  ### Step.5 Click on the Resolution box.


  ![Click on the Resolution box](/img/click-on-the-resolution-box.png "Click on the Resolution box")


  From the boxes, click on the resolution box to identify your monitor’s maximum support for the resolution.


  Here in the image, My laptop has 1386into768.


  While basically means the supported resolution for my laptop will be 720px maximum. 


  Games, movies, or whatever you play are always going to display in the resolution that a monitor can support; there is no way to extend this unless you buy a new monitor which has support for more resolutions.

  - ques: How do I know if my monitor is 1440p?
    ans: If your Monitor shows resolution something like this number 2560×1440 or
      above than this, you can say it’s 1440. However, any shorter than this
      value means to lower the resolution. Even the first value, if it’s above
      1440p. It does not mean your monitor is 1440p, and it’s the second value
      which is height. That decides the resolution. I hope it makes sense.
