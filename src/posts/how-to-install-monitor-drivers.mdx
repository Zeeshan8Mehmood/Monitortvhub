  If you’re unable to update or install drivers for your monitor. Or if you’ve
  not tried to pull this out, don’t worry. You’ve our back.


  There are two ways that you can apply to either update or install drivers for your monitor.


  The first is a manual way to install drivers.


  The second way is by using software.


  So, without delaying further. Let’s dive into the guide. 


  ## How to Install Monitor Drivers. (Manually)


  This is the most effective way that you should go for first. In case you’ve already tried or had issues with this method. You’re not bound to it. Skip this and go with the second way.


  However, let’s proceed.


  ### Step.1 Download drivers first.


  Download the drivers you wish to install on your monitor. That can be done by visiting the brand’s website that you’ve bought from. Make sure after downloading, you extract the file as mostly files wrapped in the .zip format.


  * Note the directory where the drivers have been stored. You’ll need to reference the directory later, so it’s a better and less complex way you remember the path.


  ### Step.2 Go to Device Manager.

  Move on by heading your mouse cursor on the start icon on Windows 7 and 10. It’s located on the bottom-left, and on Windows 8 you will find it hidden on the right-side, hold your cursor there for a while until some options pop-up. Right-click there>Setting> Control panel> and Device manager. This is the simple go-to device manager.


  Or the second way, which is also pretty simple. Use the windows search mode (Press Windows Icon+R) and write Control Panel, and then, using your mouse, click on the Device Manager.


  ### Step.3 Choose Your Monitor to install the Drivers.


  ![Choose your Monitor to install the drivers](/img/2.-choose-your-monitor.png "Choose your Monitor to install the drivers")


  On the Device Manager. You’ll find an option Monitor when you click on it. List of monitors’ names that you’re using will drop-down (If you’re using more than one). Choose the name of the monitor that needs drivers to be installed or updated. 


  * When you click on a monitor’s name, a page will pop-up, and from there, go to the Driver’s tab and click on Update Drivers.


  ### Step.4 Choose the Manual way to install Drivers.

  After clicking on update driver. You will be asked for the directory or path where to get the drivers. If you choose automatically, the program will itself find the updated drivers for you. 


  If you want to install some particular drivers for your monitor. Then, you should continue with the manual way that is also available there when you click on Install driver.


  ### Step.5 Upload the drivers (Final Step)


  ![Upload the drivers ](/img/4.-upload-the-drivers.png "Upload the drivers ")




  In this step, you will have to visit the folder where the driver’s file is saved (as in the First step). Be sure the file is not in the .zip format. The right extension of files that can be uploaded here is .inf. 


  Click that file and upload it as it’s supposed to be. 


  If everything goes fine, then you’ll get a successful message. I hope you get that message!


  ## Second Method


  ### Install drivers on Monitor (software)


  For installing drivers, some softwares in the market can do this job for you. The softwares not just installs drivers but also can update to the latest versions of your drivers that have been outdated. These tools can audit all the drivers installed on your computer. Letting you be aware of outdated ones so you can one-click updates if you wish.


  ### Step.1 Download a Software 


  You can search on google for this kind of software to install. Mostly have no issues, so there is not a big gap in which one to go after. By the way, I’ve installed driver booster 8, which works fine for me, so if you want to go after that. Go ahead. I do recommend it.


  ### Step.2 Installing Driver Booster 8 


  Like you happen to install apps on your monitor, install this software in the same way you position it. Formerly give it all required access to function it thoroughly.


  In case you get through any inconvenience, try to turn off any security detector software because often it gets interfered with by such software while working.


  ### Step.3 Scan for Drivers


  ![Scan for drivers](/img/5.-scan-for-drivers.png "Scan for drivers")


  When you open this software, upfront, there will be a button to scan your computer’s drivers. Click to let driver booster software examine all drivers. Often within a few seconds, it lists out all drivers for you. You can update them all with the button you see there. 


  ### Step.4 Choose Monitor’s Driver


  ![Choose Monitor’s driver](/img/6.-choose-monitor’s-driver.png "Choose Monitor’s driver")


  Your intentions might not be to update all drivers. In that case, specifically for the monitor's drivers. Scroll down and look for the monitor’s option there. At close quarters, click on the update button to get the latest drivers for that monitor. No fuss, get it done by the software.


  Also, don’t forget to check out display drivers too. If this software indicates to update them also, do it. Aside, installing/updating drivers with this software is simple and rendered effortlessly. 


  #### Author’s Remark 


  We have talked about how to update drivers for your monitor. But in the circumstances, you think why should you update drivers or install them?


  There are many solid reasons why you should do that. 


  One of them, installing drivers, will enhance your monitor’s performance. It boosts up the speed, and at the same the graphics also step-up. 


  Or without drivers, it’s reasonable that your monitor would not work, even though you’ve by default graphics-drivers that are usually equipped on all Windows. It most likely happens when you update your screen resolution. In-built drivers might not have support for that updated resolutive-monitor. Thus, you’ve to make sure you use drivers that can back up that high resolution.


  One thing more to add, on laptops if you wish to increase the graphics-performance to maximum extent. Try to update the display drivers too, most probably your laptop needs them.
