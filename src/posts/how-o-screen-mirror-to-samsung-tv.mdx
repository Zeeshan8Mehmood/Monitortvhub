  A screen mirror is a function used to share a mobile device’s screen to a
  smart TV, or vice versa. Allowing you to watch photos, videos, make
  presentations on a big screen.


  The latest Samsung TVs models that are made after 2017 most likely come up with this function in-built. If you have got the latest model, you have a higher chance to use this feature on your Samsung Smart TV. It works from both devices, android, and Ios.


  Generally, there is more than one way to mirror your screen to Samsung TV. 


  1. Smart View

  2. By SmartThings App

  3. Via Dex Cable.


  In all these methods, there is no problem at all regarding the quality or something under the hood. If one way doesn’t work, go with the second method. All methods work fine; thus, it all comes down to preference, 


  ## Smart View


  Using the Smart View function, you can mirror a screen quicker than any other method. It needs screen-mirror options on both of the devices, and luckily most mobile devices have this function only if you have a device older than 2014 (Kitkat android) at that moment. You might get into messy things.


  ### Step.1 Switch on your Samsung Smart TV


  Using your TV remote control switch your TV On. Make sure your TV has full authorization to access a third-party app. Most importantly, your TV has a SmartView function. To know this, you can read the manual-book that comes along with TVs or search the model number to see if your LED is able or not.


  ### Step.2 Turn on the Screen mirror option from your Mobile device


  ![Turn on the Screen mirror option from your Mobile device](/img/1.-turn-on-the-screen-mirror-option-from-your-mobile.png "Turn on the Screen mirror option from your Mobile")


  Drop down the notification bar pushing downward, and there you will see a mobile screen mirror option. Click to enable it. Alternatively, open your mobile settings> network and connections. You can also enable the Screen-mirror mode from there. For iPhone devices, these same steps will be applied there.


  ### Step.3 Tap to search for a nearby device to mirror-screen

  Click on these three as shown in the image. Afterward, you can see the option to scan nearby devices. Tap on it to let your mobile device detect your Samsung SmartView Connection. Quite often, it’ll not ask you to give any password to process.


  ### Step.4 Give your Hotspot’s password if asked


  In case it asked you to provide a password, then head over your hotspot connection to find out what password you’ve put on your mobile device. Copy that same password, and paste it over there. 

  Congrats, it’s done. You can now browse your mobile screen on your Samsung TV. Watch movies, photos, play games on a big screen. Don’t worry about audio, and you can listen to audio too.


  However, note that when you use the screen mirror option on a mobile device. Then, you may not be able to use the Wifi feature as long as you use the screen-mirror. There are only a few mobile devices that can run these options simultaneously.


  ## By Smart Things App


  ![Smart Things App](/img/3.-smart-things-app.png "Smart Things App")


  You can use the screen mirror feature by using the Smart Thing App. People who have ever purchased Samsung products might already know how this app functions. And what controls they can undertake with this app. In case you don’t know, then it’s an app in which you can find different control options like you can turn this into a remote control, or you can use voice commands to operate your Samsung TV (if support).


  People can also screen mirror Samsung Tv with this smart things app. 

  To do this-


  Download Smartthings App from the play store, AppStore, or its official website.

  Install it on your Mobile phone, and log in from your Samsung account or create a new one.


  Connect this app with your Samsung TV to persuade this. Tap on the three dots at the top-right corner. Using the “scan for devices” feature, you can link this to your TV.


  Once you’ve connected this app with your Samsung TV, either you can use it as a remote control that will appear on your mobile device or drop down the left-bar to go through different options in order to use them.


  There is an option to “Share screen” tap on it to share your mobile with the TV you’ve linked already. In no time, the mobile screen will be on your Samsung TV.


  ## Via Dex Cable

  You can use a Cable to use Screen mirror mode. You will have to use a DEX cable, put one end of this chord into your Samsung TV in the USB port, and put the second end into your mobile phone, mostly Type-C.


  This method mostly works with Samsung mobile devices, note series, or galaxy. So if you’re one of them or any Samsung Smartphone, then it adds more chances that this method will work for you.


  **So, how to do that?**


  It’s quite simple to follow. Make sure you have the DEX cable. If not, you can purchase that from your nearby store. Next, plug that cable in both of the devices. 


  On mobile, a notification will show asking for “Use your Mobile as a Screen Mirror.” Allow it to proceed further.


  You can now view your mobile screen on your Large LCD, watch movies, or make presentations by using your Mobile touch-pad and for detailing see your work on-going on the LED.
