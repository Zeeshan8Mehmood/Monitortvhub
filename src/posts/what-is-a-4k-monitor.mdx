  The answer can be expressed more effectively if you first understand that
  resolution and the screen size are not the same things for a monitor. There is
  a significant difference between these two terms.


  The screen is the width and length of a screen (LED or LCD) that displays a video, picture, or game as well. And anything displayed on a screen has a specific resolution, and the quality of resolution depends upon the pixels, such as 360px, 480px, 720px, and 4kpixels.

  ## What is a 4k monitor resolution?


  On a 4k monitor, you can uncover the real quality of the video or picture. The term 4K monitor refers to a monitor with resolution support of 3840 pixels in height and a width of 2160. In total, it becomes around 4 million pixels which means that it can display videos clearer, sharper, smoother—often known as UHD(ultra high definition).


  ### What is 4k resolution?


  4k resolution means the video or picture has around 4 thousand pixels, which means that video format can be played on a big screened-TV without losing the quality since it’s enriched by pixels. Also, the quality will be far better than HD format since it has almost two times more pixels. All in all, see coming closer to real-time graphics.


  It an easy to get the point, think of zooming in a 480px video format and see what happens. Of course, the video will lose its sharpness and became dull and blurry as you expand beyond its limit, or just play that video on a big screen something like a 27’’ inch TV monitor.


  Similarly, the HD resolution has the same phenomena. To identify, you have to expand it more than 480px, or when playing on a bigger screen than 27’’, however, you can identify the dots over there at some point.


  Therefore, the resolution term tells us how much a video can be zoomed in. And there, the 4k resolution means that around 4000pixels in width. The video can expand this much without losing the quality or taking any effects.

  **For example-** 


  When you see a watchable material (a picture or a video) is getting dim as you zoom in, this means you’ve exceeded the resolution of the material, the pixels have been turned apart, and the gap between them has been. On the other hand, if a material is getting more clear and sharper instead of getting blurry as you zoom in, this is telling that the material has support for more resolution than your monitor.

  Thus, 4k monitors are an essential need for everyone to enjoy the top-notch graphic experience, whether watching movies, TV shows, or gaming. But, as of now, the gaming industry is the first to revoke graphics-quality with an impressive pace. The graphics cards industry is chasing up well like Nvidia. In this way, to play games with higher graphics, your monitor must touch the requirements in order to display a detailed graph.


  Although for 4k monitors, the screen size actually doesn’t mean so much, such as on a 23'' screen, you can experience 4k graphics if you have a 4k monitor. Opposed to that, to run 4k videos on the Monitors without support for 4k will give you less or no fun. Nothing will be appealing to UHD in that case.


  ### In-Depth overview- what makes 4k called 4k?.

  To be precise here, the term 4k expresses for a highly relative-picture that ultimately refers to pixels, as the rule of thumb says; the more the pixels in a picture, the better a picture or video will be displayed on a big screen unless your Monitor can support that. 


  And if you don’t know what pixels are? They are small particles that together form an image, and as things take place, the multiple images later generate a video. 


  But the screen size plays a significant role up there. For instance, the majority of mobile devices have support for more pixels which is on average height 1080 x and width 2340 pixels, around two million in total. As things stand, these pixels per area (PPI) in mobiles are great and deliver a smooth display experience. 


  Where the PPI stands for pixels per area, in general, a screen with a greater PPI value will deliver a smooth picture.

  On the other hand, in monitors, the screen size is pretty large compared to mobiles. And the PPI value is also lower in monitors. However, the distance also takes part there, which signifies that on mobiles, we look at things closer than monitors. For this reason, even the monitors with low PPI values can draw no effect on our watching experience unless you zoom in on something and put your eyes closer to it. At that moment, you can see dots that are being caused by lower PPI values.

      There are versatile advantages of a 4K monitor, to grasp some of them; on
      4k monitors, you can watch UHD formatted content, blu-ray is leaping
      forward to come with movies for this ultimate experience. Even for gamers,
      it’s nothing less than a power-boost since you can play games to maximum
      support for graphics. 


      Although it’s too early to experience this futuristic approach as many of the watchable material is formatted in 1080px, which most devices have support for. As far as broad assumption out of the box, the 4k monitors will be dominating, such as the content creators are looking for ways to pour a more realistic approach to their content.
